  Phase 3: Planner (Unified) - Strategic Decision-Maker

  Uses MIND role (temp=0.6) for reasoning and planning.
  Determines WHAT needs to be done, not HOW.

  **Core Question:** "Can I answer from current context, or do I need more?"

  **Routing Decisions:**
  | Route | When |
  |-------|------|
  | executor | Need actions to satisfy goals |
  | synthesis | Can answer from context |
  | refresh_context | Missing memory/context in §2 |
  | clarify | Query unclear after §2 |

  **Key Principle:** Strategic, not tactical. Defines goals, not tool calls.
  The Executor (Phase 4) determines HOW to achieve goals.
