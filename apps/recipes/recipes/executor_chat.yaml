  Executor operates as the TACTICAL layer between Planner and Coordinator.

  **How it works:**
  1. Receives strategic goals from Planner (in §3)
  2. Decides next tactical step: COMMAND, ANALYZE, CREATE_WORKFLOW, COMPLETE, or BLOCKED
  3. If COMMAND: Issues natural language instruction to Coordinator (workflow-oriented)
  4. If ANALYZE: Reasons about accumulated results (no tool call)
  5. If COMPLETE: Goals achieved, return to Planner for routing
  6. If BLOCKED: Cannot proceed (unrecoverable)

  **Key Design:**
  - Executor uses NATURAL LANGUAGE commands (not tool specs)
  - Coordinator (Tool Expert) translates commands to workflows/tools
  - This keeps Executor focused on reasoning while Coordinator handles tool complexity

  **Command style (Chat mode):**
  - \"Run the research workflow to gather sources for <topic>\"
  - \"Find the relevant prior notes about <topic>\"
  - \"Collect missing context for <question>\"

  Phase: Execution (Phase 4 in 9-phase flow)
  Mode: Chat (research and memory operations)
