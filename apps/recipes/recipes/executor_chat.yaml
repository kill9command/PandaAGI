# Description
description: |
  Executor operates as the TACTICAL layer between Planner and Coordinator.

  **How it works:**
  1. Receives strategic goals from Planner (in §3)
  2. Decides next tactical step: COMMAND, ANALYZE, COMPLETE, or BLOCKED
  3. If COMMAND: Issues natural language instruction to Coordinator
  4. If ANALYZE: Reasons about accumulated results (no tool call)
  5. If COMPLETE: Goals achieved, proceed to synthesis
  6. If BLOCKED: Cannot proceed (unrecoverable)

  **Key Design:**
  - Executor uses NATURAL LANGUAGE commands (not tool specs)
  - Coordinator (Tool Expert) translates commands to tool calls
  - This keeps Executor focused on reasoning while Coordinator handles tool complexity

  **Available commands (Chat mode):**
  - "Search for [topic]" → internet.research
  - "Save to memory that [fact]" → memory.save
  - "What do I know about [topic]?" → memory.search
  - "Read the file [path]" → file.read

  Phase: Execution (Phase 4 in 9-phase flow)
  Mode: Chat (research and memory operations)
