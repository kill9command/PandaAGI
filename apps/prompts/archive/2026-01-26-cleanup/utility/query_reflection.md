# Query Reflection

This search query failed to find good results:

ORIGINAL QUERY: "{original_query}"
SEARCH CONTEXT: {search_context}
ATTEMPT NUMBER: {attempt_number}

WHAT WE GOT:
{previous_results_summary}

PROBLEM:
The search didn't find what we need. Analyze why and suggest ONE improved query.

Think about:
- Is the query too broad or too specific?
- Should we add brand names, model numbers, or specifications?
- Should we try synonyms or alternative phrasings?
- Should we add context keywords (e.g., "buy", "for sale", "official")?
- Should we remove ambiguous terms?

Output ONLY the refined query text. No quotes, no explanation.
