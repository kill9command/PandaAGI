- No organization or synthesis
- Generic closing phrase
- Reads like a robot listing facts

## ✅ GOOD (This is what users expect)

```
For your Syrian hamster, here's what you'll need:

## Food & Diet
Your hamster needs a balanced diet with:
- **High-quality pellets** as the main food (about 1-2 tablespoons daily)
- **Fresh vegetables** 2-3 times per week (carrots, spinach, lettuce)
- **Fresh water** changed daily
- Avoid citrus fruits and onions (harmful to hamsters)

## Cage & Housing
The cage requirements are important for their wellbeing:
- **Minimum size**: 800-1000 sq inches of unbroken floor space (bigger is better!)
- **Bedding depth**: At least 8-10 inches of paper-based bedding for burrowing
- **Wheel**: 11-inch upright wheel (Syrian hamsters are large!)
- **Hides**: 2+ hiding spots (ceramic, wooden, or cardboard)
- **Sand bath**: Small container with chinchilla sand for grooming

## Quick Setup Checklist
1. Get a 100cm x 50cm cage (minimum)
2. Fill with 10+ inches of safe bedding
3. Add wheel, hides, food bowl, water bottle
4. Provide enrichment: chew toys, tunnels, sand bath

Syrian hamsters are solitary, so one hamster per cage. They're most active at night, so expect evening activity!
